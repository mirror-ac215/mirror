# Mirror: shared project context

Paste this file at the start of any LLM session, followed by your own `brief_<name>.md`.

## What we are building

Mirror is a prototype web app for AC215 (Harvard, Fall 2026), not a clinical product. A patient chats with a direct, supportive persona. If the patient consents, their webcam feeds a facial-expression model, and the emotional tone of their text is scored too. Both signals are combined into **one bounded, uncertainty-labelled context object per chat turn**, and that object shapes the persona's reply. A clinician dashboard shows each patient's affect trend across sessions and a "needs review" marker.

**Safety rule:** a deterministic check on the patient's *text* runs before the LLM. When it fires, it shows crisis resources (988), withholds the persona reply, and sets a review flag. The face model never triggers it. There are no real-time alerts and no emergency automation.

Inherited assets:

| Asset | Details |
|---|---|
| CV model | PyTorch; FER-2013, 7 classes; best about 67% accuracy, 0.64 macro-F1; ViT-B/16, EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNetV3 checkpoints |
| Persona LLM | Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct with a QLoRA adapter (r=32) trained on about 3k prompt/response pairs |

## Team

| Person | Role |
|---|---|
| Mostafa | Coordinator, product and integration: api-gateway orchestration, frontend shell and webcam (from the Lovable prototype), docker-compose integration, milestone submissions |
| Owen | Platform and backend: repo, service template, GCP, shared CI/CD, GPU VM deployment, llm-service, database, auth, clinician API, E2E tests |
| Julie | LLM and NLP: persona data, LoRA retrain on Vertex AI, prompt template, text-emotion module, crisis-check rules, chat UI, evaluation, load test, monitoring dashboard, demo video |
| Samuel | Data science and CV: data pipeline and DVC, cv-service, retraining, smoothing/gating, fairness audit, W&B, clinician dashboard |

The frontend is split across the team: Mostafa builds the app shell and webcam, Julie the chat screen, and Samuel the clinician dashboard.

**MLOps is shared: "you build it, you ship it."** Whoever owns a container or job also owns its MLOps work:
- its Dockerfile and uv lockfile
- its tests and its CI job
- its data or model versioning
- its logs and `/metrics` endpoint
- its README

Owen owns the shared platform the rest of us plug into: the template, the GCP project, the CI/CD pipeline and the VM.

## Architecture

```
Browser (React)
  |  HTTPS
Caddy proxy ── /      -> frontend (nginx, :3000)
            └─ /api   -> api-gateway (FastAPI, :8000)
                           ├─ cv-service   (FastAPI + PyTorch CPU, :8001)
                           ├─ llm-service  (vLLM / transformers + LoRA, GPU, :8002)
                           └─ db           (Postgres, :5432)
Jobs (run on demand, not always on):
  data-preprocess, persona-data, cv-train, fairness-audit, llm-finetune, llm-eval, load-test, e2e
Storage: GCS bucket (data via DVC, model versions under gs://<bucket>/models/<name>/<version>/)
Tracking: Weights & Biases team "mirror"
Deploy: one GCP VM with a T4 GPU running docker compose; images in Artifact Registry tagged by git SHA
```

## One chat turn, step by step

1. While the camera is on, the frontend sends a downscaled JPEG to `POST /api/sessions/{id}/frames` every 1-2 s.
2. The gateway forwards each frame to `cv-service /predict` and keeps the probabilities in a short in-memory window. Frames are never stored.
3. The patient sends text to `POST /api/sessions/{id}/messages`.
4. The gateway runs these steps in order:
   - **Safety check.** If it fires: return the crisis payload, set a review flag, stop.
   - **Text-emotion module:** score the text.
   - **Smoothing and gating** over the visual window, giving `ok`, `uncertain`, `dropped` or `camera_off`.
   - **Fusion:** build the context object, including agreement and tone mode.
   - **Reply:** call `llm-service` with the prompt template plus the context object, stream the reply back over SSE, and store the message and an aggregated emotion window.
5. The clinician dashboard reads aggregated windows and review flags through `/api/clinician/*`.

Every failure falls back to a normal text-only reply: camera off, CV service down, low confidence, or LLM timeout.

## Contracts (the source of truth lives in docs/contracts; do not change them without the affected owners)

### cv-service `POST /predict`
Request: `multipart/form-data` with an `image` field (JPEG).

Response:
```json
{
  "face_found": true,
  "probs": {"angry":0.03,"disgust":0.01,"fear":0.05,"happy":0.10,"neutral":0.31,"sad":0.46,"surprise":0.04},
  "top2": [["sad",0.46],["neutral",0.31]],
  "margin": 0.15,
  "uncertain": false,
  "model_version": "cv-vit-b16-v3",
  "latency_ms": 42
}
```

### Context object (gateway -> llm-service, one per turn)
```json
{
  "visual": {"status": "ok", "top2": [["sad",0.46],["neutral",0.31]], "stability": 0.8, "window_s": 10, "n_frames": 8},
  "text":   {"top2": [["sadness",0.71],["neutral",0.12]]},
  "agreement": "agree",
  "tone_mode": "supportive",
  "note": "Estimates of expression, not facts about feelings."
}
```

Allowed values:
- `visual.status`: `ok`, `uncertain`, `dropped` or `camera_off`
- `agreement`: `agree`, `disagree` or `n/a`
- `tone_mode`: `coach` or `supportive`

The persona must never state the expression as a fact. When the signals disagree, it asks instead of assuming.

### Safety payload (gateway -> frontend, replaces the persona reply)
```json
{"type": "crisis", "message": "...", "resources": [{"name": "988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline", "contact": "call or text 988"}], "review_flag_created": true}
```

### Database (no raw frames, ever)
| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `users` | id, role (`patient` or `clinician`), display_name, password_hash |
| `patients` | user_id, clinician_id |
| `sessions` | id, patient_id, started_at, ended_at, camera_consent |
| `messages` | id, session_id, role, text, created_at, safety_hit |
| `emotion_windows` | id, session_id, ts, visual_status, visual_top2 (json), text_top2 (json), tone_mode |
| `review_flags` | id, patient_id, message_id, created_at, reviewed_at, reviewed_by |

## Conventions

**Environment and packages.** Each Python folder is its own uv project using Python 3.11, with `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` committed.
- Set up after cloning with `uv sync`.
- Run code with `uv run python ...`.
- Add a package with `uv add <pkg>`.
- Never use pip or conda in the project.

**Config and secrets.** Configuration comes from environment variables via pydantic-settings. Commit `.env.example` and never `.env`. Secrets are mounted read-only from `secrets/`.

**Services.** Every service exposes `GET /health` and `GET /metrics`, and writes JSON logs that carry `X-Request-ID`.

**Tests and CI.** Tests use pytest. CI runs ruff, pytest and docker build on every PR, and the safety tests always run.

**Git workflow.**
- Branch name: `<initials>/<task-id>-short-name`.
- Commit messages start with the task ID.
- Each PR needs one reviewer and green CI.

### Dockerfile pattern (Python services)
```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-bookworm-slim
WORKDIR /app
ENV UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1 UV_LINK_MODE=copy
# install dependencies first so this layer is cached when only code changes
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./
RUN uv sync --frozen --no-install-project --no-dev
COPY . .
RUN uv sync --frozen --no-dev
EXPOSE 8000
HEALTHCHECK CMD python -c "import urllib.request; urllib.request.urlopen('http://localhost:8000/health')"
CMD ["uv", "run", "uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

## Milestones and build gates

| Milestone | Dates | Gate / focus |
|---|---|---|
| MS2 MLOps infrastructure | Oct 5 - 18 | **v0:** every container runs with `/health`; data pipelines are reproducible (DVC); CI runs on PRs |
| MS3 Integration and deployment | Oct 19 - Nov 8 | **v1:** frame goes through CV, then gate plus text emotion, then the context object, then the LLM; safety check; first deployment on a GCP VM |
| MS4 Design and development | Nov 9 - 29 | **v2:** dashboard on real data, auth, fallbacks, end-to-end test in CI, CD, load test, monitoring, evaluation, model cards |
| MS5 Final | Nov 30 - Dec 12 | Polish and demo; at most one stretch feature (RAG, avatar or licensed voice), and only if v2 is stable |

## Oral checks (MS2-MS4)

A TF may ask any of us about any part of the project. Each of us needs to be able to say, in our own words: "This component takes X as input, does Y, and passes Z to the next part."

"Claude did that for me" is explicitly not accepted. Use your LLM to learn, not just to produce code.
